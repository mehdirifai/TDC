# TDC
This repo contains a set of tools I used in the TDC project.

Cluster_variables is clustering the variables and extracting in every cluster the variable that has the highest WOE against a target varaible.

Top_down_algorithm is an algorithm that looks for maximizing a metric (or multiple metrics) by binning the dataset and going through a set of specific and ranked varaiables.

Binning is breaking down the dataset into smaller bins using a set of variables and break points.

ROC_curves plots mutiples ROC curves on the same grid.

TDC_scoring return the TDC score and append it to the dataset.
